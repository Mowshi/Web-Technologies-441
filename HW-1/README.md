This assignment was very much needed for me because I nearly forgot everything about
making a web page in the short 3 weeks of break we had from school. It took a bit for me
to remember how to format with the doc type and css page linking and stuff like that
but I slowly remembered most of my basics from last semester. I skipped out on
going overboard with css stuff like dropdown menus and stuff like that for now
because I did not feel it was very needed. Also you might have noticed that I went a
little light hearted on the business and information, I hope you can get a kick
out of it :D
