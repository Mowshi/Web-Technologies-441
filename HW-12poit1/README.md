This kinda reminds me of the little games we made a couple semesters
ago where we made our own sprites and animated them with controls. I dont think
the live server in atom is working very well for me but I double checked my code and
assets folder and it all seems fine. I even changed some of the sprites around
to make sure the pngs were not the problem.
