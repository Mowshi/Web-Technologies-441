- Luckily for me, I have some experience with JS so I was not intimated when I saw
the topic for this week's work. I obviously do not know everything there is to know
about it but I already knew how to write comments in the console log and insert
the script tag. I still did all the recommended exorcises and watched the lecture
videos for practice. After that jumped into my code and started answering the
questions.
