        <p>a way out of the situation, but upon closer examination of the cyborgs, you notice they are lactose intolerance. You look down at your plate and remeber the glass of milk you ordered. Do you fight them off with the milk or run for the exit?</p>

        <p>"this is not what I sighned up for" you thought to yourself as the ninjas got closer to you, drawing their weapons. You decied to run to the exit but remembered that you didn't pay for your food yet. Unfortunatly, the extra</p>
        <p>minute spent pulling out your wallet gave the ninjas enough time to slice you up with katanas. Game over! You reached the BAD ending!</p>

        <p>The cyborgs have you surounded so you knew there was only one way out of this mess; you had to fight. However, your combat skills against cyborgs had been rusty, so you get a clever idea of throwing your milk at the lactose intolerance</p>
        <p>foes. Unfortunatly, the waiter brought you almond milk which had no effecft on the cyborgs. instead, they just get angry and kill you. Game over! You reached the BAD ending!</p>

        <p>The cyborgs where well equiped in hand to hand combat so you knew fighting them was not a good option, instead, you flee for the door after paying for your meal. To your surprise, the cyborgs</p>
        <p>did not pursue. Instead, they admired you for paying for you meal even in the face of danger and let you escape. Congradulations! you reached the GOOD ending!</p>
