If I gave myself a bit more time to work on this, I would have eventually figured
out how to get all the text spaces to work, but I did not budget myself enough time.
I thought one weekend would be plenty but I was mistaken. I kept trying
different things that never seemed to give me the result I needed to achieve which
ended up taking many hours. I'll start setting aside more time for this class in
the future. I apologize for the back to back uncompleted assignments.
