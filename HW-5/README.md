So I took my own advice and gave myself 3 whole days to work on this assignment.
This allowed me to work on the code for a few hours one day, take a break, and come
back to it with fresh eyes which helped tremendously. Over all, I don't think the
assignment was too hard, it definitely helps to be working on it in chucks at a 
time.
